			<h1>Which sentence is more simple?</h1>

			<p>In this HIT, you will read pairs of sentences. Your task is to decide which of the two sentences is more &quot;simple&quot;, or easier to read and understand. The options are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Sentence 1 is more simple (easier to read) than Sentence 2.</li>
				<li>Both sentences are the same difficulty.</li>
				<li>Sentence 1 is more difficult than Sentence 2.</li>
			</ul>
			In this HIT, the two sentences should be describing the same thing and one is a simplified version of the other. However, some sentence pairs may describe <b>different</b> things. If you think that this is the case, check the box next to &quot;Neither sentence is a simplification of the other&quot;.

			<p>For example, #2 below is a simplified version of #1 but #3 is not a simplified version of either sentence.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The War of 1812 was a military conflict fought between the forces of the United States of America and those of the British Empire, stemming from impressment of American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy and British support of American Indian tribes against American expansion.</li>
				<li>The United States and the British Empire fought each other in the War of 1812 for a variety of reasons.</li>
				<li>During the War of 1812, the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the U.S. and mounted large-scale raids in the later stages of the war.</li>
				<li>The United States and the British Empire fought each other in the War of 1812. One cause of the war was when the British began kidnapping American sailors and forcing them to serve in the British navy. Another cause was British support of American Indian tribes against American expansion.</li>
			</ol>
			It is possible that one of the sentences in the pair is actually more than one sentence (or a &quot;paragraph&quot;). In this case, you should consider whether that &quot;paragraph&quot; is easier or more difficult to read than than the other sentence in the pair. For example, #4 is a simplification of #1, even though #4 is longer. Length is not a reliable way to decide which sentence is more simple.</td>
